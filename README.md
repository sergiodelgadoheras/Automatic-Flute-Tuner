# Automatic-Flute-Tuner--Arduino

This project had the goal to create a closed loop control system, where I chose a plunger flute as plant. 

## Topics

The strog points of this project are the following ones: 
* Audio signal processing
* Frequency acquisition algorithm
* PID control
* Embedded system: Arduino

On the next video I explain the whole project in Spanish, and it is possible to watch a performance of the system.
